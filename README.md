### League Challenge 2

* Easy: Make a simple Blackjack game. Player vs PC. Both are given two cards to begin with, the player is shown one card of the PC's, the player then has to try to beat the PC's hand, without going over 21. (As the rules state, if you go over 21, you lose)
The PC always automatically plays. The PC will always 'draw' a card if they are under 17, will 'stand' if they are between 17 and 21, and will 'bust' if they are over 21. Aces are always one. In the case of a draw, ensure 'draw' is noted.

* Medium: Using before as the base, and then add on gambling. Player starts with $100, PC has infinite money and will always match every bet, please include a minimum bet. When the player makes a bet, their money goes down, if they win, they make double their money back, if they lose, they lose their money, if draw, refund. And, all cards will 'show' the card number and card suit that they represent. Aces are either 1 or 11 depending on the sum of the cards.

* Hard: Same as all above, but also, add in realistic decks. You start with a deck of 52 cards, you draw a 5 of clubs for the PC, that 5 of clubs is no longer available to be drawn. If the player exhausts the deck, 'begin' a new deck.
